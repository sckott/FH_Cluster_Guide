Fred Hutch maintains a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HPCC}{high performance computing cluster} specifically to support work that requires intensive computing. The Fred Hutch cluster (sometimes called ``Rhino'' and/or ``Gizmo'') allow you to do more than your average desktop computer can handle.

Our goal for this course is to get you running on the Fred Hutch cluster \textbf{quickly and efficiently}. It is intended for everyone from brand new cluster users to researchers who have used a cluster at another institution but are new to Fred Hutch. We hope that the following modules will help you take advantage of the powerful resources the Fred Hutch has to offer!

The Fred Hutch cluster is supported by a group in IT called Scientific Computing, and this course was developed by the Fred Hutch Data Science Lab in collaboration with them. Please see the \protect\hyperlink{about-the-authors}{author credits} for more information.

This course is available in \href{https://hutchdatascience.org/FH_Cluster_Guide}{Bookdown} and \href{https://leanpub.com/courses/fredhutch/fredhutchcluster101}{Leanpub} formats. If you want a certificate, you need to take the Leanpub version of the course. \textbf{The Leanpub course can be taken for free, but you still have to put the course in your cart and check out}.

\chapter{What is a Cluster}\label{what-is-a-cluster}}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{resources/images/01-cluster_files/figure-latex//1BQxrVYdKZTbpCaF-i_q9w7s9x034lEXpQZDU-Sl09cs_gff2211b72f_1_114} \end{center}

A computing cluster is a set of many computers networked together. Because there are many computers working together, the network is able to handle computationally expensive tasks, like genome assemblies or advanced algorithms. Imagine you're building a house. It would take a long time by yourself! It's much better to have many builders working together.

Now that we have a team of workers, the next challenge is task management. A home construction team will need a manager to help delegate tasks. Similarly, the computing cluster uses management software to prioritize tasks, delegate workers (resources), and check on progress. The Fred Hutch cluster uses a common management and scheduling tool called \href{https://slurm.schedmd.com/overview.html}{Slurm}.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{resources/images/01-cluster_files/figure-latex//1BQxrVYdKZTbpCaF-i_q9w7s9x034lEXpQZDU-Sl09cs_g149d37dd4a1_0_18} \end{center}

How is the cluster different from a laptop or desktop? First, on your laptop you most likely interact with it using an operating system like Windows or MacOS. The Fred Hutch cluster uses a Linux operating system. Second, because many people use the cluster for many tasks, there isn't a central screen and keyboard. You access the cluster remotely from your computer! We will talk more about how to connect to the cluster in a \protect\hyperlink{terminal}{following chapter}.

\textbf{Computing cluster}

A set of computers networked together to perform large tasks.

\hypertarget{account-setup}{%
\chapter{Account Setup}\label{account-setup}}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{resources/images/02-accounts_files/figure-latex//1BQxrVYdKZTbpCaF-i_q9w7s9x034lEXpQZDU-Sl09cs_gff2211b72f_1_160} \end{center}

You will need an account to log in to the cluster. This ensures that data stays protected and that computing resources are shared fairly.

\hypertarget{check-your-hutchnet-id}{%
\section{Check your HutchNet ID}\label{check-your-hutchnet-id}}

Your \href{https://centernet.fredhutch.org/cn/u/center-it/help-desk.html}{HutchNet ID} is the standard login you receive when you start working at the Hutch or are an official affiliate. You can use it to login to most resources at Fred Hutch (Desktop Computer, Employee Self Service, VPN, Webmail) and our Scientific Computing systems.

For example:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  my email is \texttt{jsmith3@fredhutch.org}.\\
\item
  my HutchNet ID is \texttt{jsmith3}.
\end{itemize}

If one of your collaborators requires access to the Fred Hutch network you can submit a \href{https://centernet.fredhutch.org/cn/f/hr/lcex/non-employee-action-form.html}{non-employee action form}. ``Non-employee'' is a generic administrative term for affiliates, students, contractors, etc.

\hypertarget{pi-account}{%
\section{Connect to a PI Account}\label{pi-account}}

Your HutchNet ID must be associated with a PI cluster ``account''. The Scientific Computing Team (SciComp) tries to set users up with a connection to a PI account before they need it, but this is not automatic! To ensure that you have been set up to use the cluster, please follow the following steps. You must be connected to the campus wifi network, plugged into a networked ethernet jack, or connected to the Fred Hutch VPN.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Go to the \href{https://scicomp-self-service.fredhutch.org/}{SciComp Self-Service Portal}
\item
  Click on ``Check Access''
\item
  Log in using your HutchNet ID (no \texttt{@fredhutch.org}) and password
\end{enumerate}

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{resources/images/02-accounts_files/figure-latex//1BQxrVYdKZTbpCaF-i_q9w7s9x034lEXpQZDU-Sl09cs_g166d4f31b2e_0_0}

If everything is green as shown below, you are ready to proceed. You can \protect\hyperlink{terminal}{proceed with the course} or \protect\hyperlink{skip-to-certification}{skip to certification}.

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{resources/images/02-accounts_files/figure-latex//1BQxrVYdKZTbpCaF-i_q9w7s9x034lEXpQZDU-Sl09cs_g166d4f31b2e_0_5}

If you see anything in red as shown below, click the link to e-mail SciComp to finish setting up your account. Be sure to include your HutchNetID and PI name in the email.

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{resources/images/02-accounts_files/figure-latex//1BQxrVYdKZTbpCaF-i_q9w7s9x034lEXpQZDU-Sl09cs_g166d4f31b2e_0_10}

Note that it may take just a bit of time for SciComp to see your email request, but it is usually fairly quick! Once approved, you will receive an email back from the SciComp team that you now have cluster access. The Self-Service Portal will also show that you have cluster access if you refresh the page.

Now, let's connect to the cluster!

The next step is getting familiar with your Terminal. This is your portal to the cluster.

\hypertarget{what-is-a-terminal}{%
\section{What is a terminal?}\label{what-is-a-terminal}}

The Terminal is a \href{https://www.codecademy.com/article/command-line-interface}{command line interface}. In other words, the Terminal is a software application that allows you to issue commands directly to your laptop or desktop computer. The Terminal is very useful because it allows you to run commands that don't have a point-and-click equivalent. It can also connect you to computer networks, such as the Fred Hutch cluster! The Terminal setup is different depending on your operating system. Jump to the \protect\hyperlink{windows}{Windows}, \protect\hyperlink{mac}{MacOS}, or \protect\hyperlink{linux}{Linux} sections below.

``Terminal'' used to be synonymous with ``computer''. With the creation of operating systems like Windows and MacOS, computers became much easier to use and exploded in popularity! Your colleagues are almost always referring to the command line application when they say ``Terminal''.

\hypertarget{windows}{%
\section{Windows Setup}\label{windows}}

Click to view steps

You will need to install a Terminal application called PuTTY to connect to the Fred Hutch Cluster.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  You should then see PuTTY available in the Software Center. Click ``Install'' and go through the Setup Wizard.

  \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{resources/images/03-terminal_files/figure-latex//1BQxrVYdKZTbpCaF-i_q9w7s9x034lEXpQZDU-Sl09cs_g15643d101eb_4_15}

  \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{resources/images/03-terminal_files/figure-latex//1BQxrVYdKZTbpCaF-i_q9w7s9x034lEXpQZDU-Sl09cs_g15643d101eb_4_20}

  You can also \href{faq.html\#manual-putty}{install PuTTY manually} if you don't see it in the Software Center.
\item
  PuTTY should now be available in your applications. Click on PuTTY to open.

  \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{resources/images/03-terminal_files/figure-latex//1BQxrVYdKZTbpCaF-i_q9w7s9x034lEXpQZDU-Sl09cs_g15643d101eb_4_28}
\item
  You should now see the PuTTY Configuration menu.

  \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{resources/images/03-terminal_files/figure-latex//1BQxrVYdKZTbpCaF-i_q9w7s9x034lEXpQZDU-Sl09cs_g15643d101eb_4_35}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{mac}{%
\section{Mac Setup}\label{mac}}

Mac machines come with a Terminal installed.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Go to Finder \textgreater{} Applications \textgreater{} Utilities \textgreater{} Terminal and double-click.

  \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{resources/images/03-terminal_files/figure-latex//1BQxrVYdKZTbpCaF-i_q9w7s9x034lEXpQZDU-Sl09cs_g149d37dd4a1_0_9}
\item
  Your Terminal should look like this:

  \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{resources/images/03-terminal_files/figure-latex//1BQxrVYdKZTbpCaF-i_q9w7s9x034lEXpQZDU-Sl09cs_g149d37dd4a1_0_2}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{linux}{%
\section{Linux Setup}\label{linux}}

Click to view steps

The commonly used Linux distribution, Ubuntu, already comes with a Terminal installed.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Press ctrl + alt + T. This should open a Terminal window.
\item
  Update the Terminal and prepare it for connecting to the cluster by running:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
sudo apt install openssh-client
\end{verbatim}

Enter your password and enter \texttt{Y} when prompted.

\hypertarget{logging-in}{%
\chapter{Logging In}\label{logging-in}}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{resources/images/04-logging-in_files/figure-latex//1BQxrVYdKZTbpCaF-i_q9w7s9x034lEXpQZDU-Sl09cs_gff2211b72f_1_206} \end{center}

Now that you have your Terminal application ready, you want to connect to the cluster. You will do this using a method called \href{https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/protocol}{SSH}, which stands for ``Secure SHell''.

\hypertarget{what-is-ssh}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{What is \texttt{SSH}?}{What is SSH?}}\label{what-is-ssh}}

SSH is a secure way to remotely connect to another computer or network of computers. In other words, SSH helps us protect your data and the data on the Fred Hutch cluster through authentication.

\textbf{Hostname}

The hostname is the name, or label, assigned to a computer in a network. We are connecting to hostname \texttt{rhino.fhcrc.org} or \texttt{rhino} for short.

\hypertarget{connect-securely}{%
\section{Connect Securely}\label{connect-securely}}

Before moving on, you will need to connect to the Fred Hutch wifi network, a networked ethernet jack, or the \href{https://centernet.fredhutch.org/cn/u/center-it/help-desk/vpn.html}{Fred Hutch VPN}. This is the first layer of security.

The next set of steps are specific to your operating system.

\hypertarget{windows-login}{%

\hypertarget{submit-your-first-job}{%
\chapter{Submit Your First Job}\label{submit-your-first-job}}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{resources/images/05-first-job_files/figure-latex//1BQxrVYdKZTbpCaF-i_q9w7s9x034lEXpQZDU-Sl09cs_gff2211b72f_1_229} \end{center}

The strength of a computing cluster is the ability to do many jobs in parallel or on computers with more computing power than you have on your local computer. The best way to use the cluster is to create short snippets of instructions (a script) that a computer can perform without human input. Your script tells the computers to execute the instructions as individual jobs.

Now that you've logged into rhino you will be able to send scripts to the networked computers in the cluster. The Fred Hutch cluster uses \href{https://slurm.schedmd.com/overview.html}{Slurm} to organize and prioritize jobs. Based on the instructions in your script, Slurm will find computing resources within the cluster to run your job along with all the other requests from other users.

In the next steps, we will go through a simple example where we download a single file. More complicated examples will use multiple files. We will discuss how to transfer files from your computer to the cluster in the \protect\hyperlink{file-upload-and-download}{following chapter}.

The part of the cluster where you \textbf{log in} is called \texttt{rhino}.
The part of the cluster where \textbf{jobs are run} is called \texttt{gizmo}.

\hypertarget{download-the-script}{%
\section{Download the Script}\label{download-the-script}}

We can use the \texttt{wget} command to download a script from GitHub. This means we don't have to write the script from scratch. Copy and paste the following into the terminal, and hit return:

\begin{verbatim}
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FredHutch/slurm-examples/master/introduction/1-hello-world/01.sh
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{resources/images/05-first-job_files/figure-latex//1BQxrVYdKZTbpCaF-i_q9w7s9x034lEXpQZDU-Sl09cs_g1579ffd7b01_0_0}

\hypertarget{confirm-the-download}{%
\section{Confirm the Download}\label{confirm-the-download}}

Let's confirm that we can see the file we just downloaded. We can use the \texttt{ls} (list files) command for this. Type \texttt{ls} and hit return. You should see the file \texttt{01.sh} in your home directory. The \texttt{.sh} ending means this is a script meant to run from the command line.

\begin{verbatim}
ls
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{resources/images/05-first-job_files/figure-latex//1BQxrVYdKZTbpCaF-i_q9w7s9x034lEXpQZDU-Sl09cs_g1579ffd7b01_0_6}

\hypertarget{inspect-the-script}{%
\section{Inspect the Script}\label{inspect-the-script}}

Let's next inspect the script. The \texttt{cat} command, followed by a file name, lists the entire contents of a specific file.

\begin{verbatim}
cat 01.sh
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{resources/images/05-first-job_files/figure-latex//1BQxrVYdKZTbpCaF-i_q9w7s9x034lEXpQZDU-Sl09cs_g1579ffd7b01_12_2}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The first line of the script, \texttt{\#!/bin/bash}, indicates that this is a command line or ``bash'' script.
\item
  The second line is empty, and the third line, \texttt{echo\ "Hello,\ World"} means that the computer will ``echo'', or print out, ``Hello, World''.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{submit-the-script}{%
\section{Submit the Script}\label{submit-the-script}}

We use the \texttt{sbatch} command to submit a script and start running a job on the cluster. Copy the following and hit return. You should see a message like ``\texttt{Submitted\ batch\ job\ 12345678}''. Your number will vary because this is a unique job identifier.

\begin{verbatim}
sbatch 01.sh
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{check-the-output}{%
\section{Check the Output}\label{check-the-output}}

Type \texttt{ls} again. You should now see a log file like \texttt{slurm-12345678.out} listed alongside your script \texttt{01.sh}. Let's use \texttt{cat} to inspect the output in the log file (the new file starting with \texttt{slurm} and ending with \texttt{.out}). Make sure you replace \texttt{{[}your-number-here{]}} with the number in your actual file. We should see our message has been printed!

\begin{verbatim}
cat slurm-[your-number-here].out
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{resources/images/05-first-job_files/figure-latex//1BQxrVYdKZTbpCaF-i_q9w7s9x034lEXpQZDU-Sl09cs_g1579ffd7b01_12_22}

\texttt{ls}

This command lists the files in the current directory.

\texttt{cat\ filename}

This command prints the contents of a specific file (\emph{filename}).

\texttt{sbatch\ filename.sh}

This command submits a job to the cluster with instructions specified in a \texttt{.sh} file.

\hypertarget{file-upload-and-download}{%
\chapter{File Upload and Download}\label{file-upload-and-download}}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{resources/images/06-upload-download_files/figure-latex//1BQxrVYdKZTbpCaF-i_q9w7s9x034lEXpQZDU-Sl09cs_gff2211b72f_1_252} \end{center}

Exchanging files with the cluster is very important. You can imagine scenarios where:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  You want to download log files or output files
\item
  You want to upload a custom \texttt{.sh} script file that you wrote on your laptop
\item
  You want to upload other files
\end{itemize}

In this course, upload and download of files is performed using \href{https://cyberduck.io/}{Cyberduck}. Cyberduck is a tool that lets us connect to the cluster securely, browse files, and transfer files securely.

If you are working with sensitive data (such as data with \href{https://www.hhs.gov/answers/hipaa/what-is-phi/index.html}{PHI} that requires \href{https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html}{HIPAA compliance}, you need to be extra cautious about transferring your data to the cluster. Your home directory is not an appropriate storage option for such data. Make sure you consider any stipulations in your data use agreements.

\hypertarget{download-cyberduck}{%
\section{Download Cyberduck}\label{download-cyberduck}}

Download the latest version of Cyberduck \href{https://cyberduck.io/download/}{here}.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{resources/images/06-upload-download_files/figure-latex//1BQxrVYdKZTbpCaF-i_q9w7s9x034lEXpQZDU-Sl09cs_g16e400fe3e8_0_0} \end{center}

Note that the version of Cyberduck in the Software Center or Self Service might not be current, causing compatibility issues with some operating systems.

\hypertarget{create-connection}{%
\section{Create Connection}\label{create-connection}}

Launch Cyberduck and click on ``Open Connection''.

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{resources/images/06-upload-download_files/figure-latex//1BQxrVYdKZTbpCaF-i_q9w7s9x034lEXpQZDU-Sl09cs_gff2211b72f_1_0}

The job numbers included in log file names generally increase in number. The greater the number, the more recently the job was run.

Use the \texttt{cat} command to inspect the log. Make sure you replace \texttt{{[}your-number-here{]}} to match your file. The message should show the new text that you added!

\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{resources/images/06-upload-download_files/figure-latex//1BQxrVYdKZTbpCaF-i_q9w7s9x034lEXpQZDU-Sl09cs_gff2211b72f_1_6}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{resources/images/07-interactive_files/figure-latex//1BQxrVYdKZTbpCaF-i_q9w7s9x034lEXpQZDU-Sl09cs_gff2211b72f_1_275} \end{center}

While using the cluster, you might need to build and test scripts interactively before running them. Luckily, you can work directly on the cluster by creating an interactive session. When you launch an interactive session, the cluster assigns you a portion of the networked computers called a ``node''. This node (or part of one) is dedicated to you for a period of time rather than using the Slurm job submission system.

Because an interactive session takes up resources directly on the cluster whether you're actively using it or not, it's best to use interactive sessions only when a task cannot be done by submitting a script.

\hypertarget{starting-the-session}{%
\section{Starting the session}\label{starting-the-session}}

When starting an interactive session, you're going to need to think about what you are testing and what resources you might need on the node you are requesting to use. You can always start an interactive session using the default values if you aren't sure what you need yet.

Start an interactive session on a node by running the command:

\begin{verbatim}
grabnode
\end{verbatim}

You will be prompted with several questions about the type of resources on the node you want. We don't need anything fancy, so we will set up the session to use minimal resources. You can enter the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{How many CPUs/cores would you like to grab on the node?} \textbf{1}
\item
  \emph{How much memory (GB) would you like to grab?} \textbf{20}
\item
  \emph{Please enter the max number of days you would like to grab this node:} \textbf{1}
\item
  \emph{Do you need a GPU?} \textbf{N}
\item
  When prompted, enter your password
\end{itemize}

The CPU, or Central Processing Unit, is the brain of the computer that performs and orchestrates computational tasks. Modern computers often perform multiple tasks at once, ranging from 4 tasks on a typical laptop to 48 tasks or more on higher end servers.

RAM, or Random Access Memory, is often simply referred to as memory. This short term memory holds the information that the CPU needs to perform calculations. One distinctive feature of memory is that it is short term. In other words, when the electricity is shut off, the data stored in memory disappears. To save the CPU's work, you usually save files to your computer. Running highly complicated analyses or algorithms can often require additional memory resources.

The \href{https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/processors/what-is-a-gpu.html}{GPU}, or Graphics Processing Unit, is similar to the CPU. The GPU was originally designed to quickly render graphics (such as for video games), but today can be used to run complex artificial intelligence applications or computationally intensive jobs.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{resources/images/07-interactive_files/figure-latex//1BQxrVYdKZTbpCaF-i_q9w7s9x034lEXpQZDU-Sl09cs_gff2211b72f_1_26} \end{center}

You will see that you are now logged on to ``gizmo'' instead of ``rhino''. Remember that the part of the cluster where you log in is called \texttt{rhino}. The part of the cluster where jobs are run is called \texttt{gizmo}.

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{resources/images/07-interactive_files/figure-latex//1BQxrVYdKZTbpCaF-i_q9w7s9x034lEXpQZDU-Sl09cs_gff2211b72f_1_50}

\hypertarget{running-interactive-commands}{%
\section{Running Interactive Commands}\label{running-interactive-commands}}

You can start working on the node by running a similar command as we used in the job we submitted via script. Echo a message by running:

\begin{verbatim}
echo "Hello, again!"
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{resources/images/07-interactive_files/figure-latex//1BQxrVYdKZTbpCaF-i_q9w7s9x034lEXpQZDU-Sl09cs_gff2211b72f_1_58}

\hypertarget{using-pre-installed-software-modules}{%
\section{Using Pre-installed Software Modules}\label{using-pre-installed-software-modules}}

Let's get a bit more advanced. We can load a preconfigured software bundle called a module. This is very convenient because it means we don't need to install anything manually! In this example, we will load a module containing \href{https://www.r-project.org/}{R} version 4.2.0. You can learn more about what modules are available and how to request new ones for the Fred Hutch cluster \href{https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/scicomputing/compute_scientificSoftware/}{here}.

\begin{verbatim}
ml fhR/4.2.0-foss-2021b
\end{verbatim}

Next, launch R:

\begin{verbatim}
R
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{resources/images/07-interactive_files/figure-latex//1BQxrVYdKZTbpCaF-i_q9w7s9x034lEXpQZDU-Sl09cs_gff2211b72f_1_65}

You can play around with R here. For example, you might run:

\begin{verbatim}
head(mtcars)
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{resources/images/07-interactive_files/figure-latex//1BQxrVYdKZTbpCaF-i_q9w7s9x034lEXpQZDU-Sl09cs_gff2211b72f_1_72}

Close the R session by typing:

\begin{verbatim}
q()
\end{verbatim}

R will ask if you want to save your workspace. Type \texttt{n} for no and hit return.

Close the interactive node by typing:

\begin{verbatim}
exit
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{resources/images/07-interactive_files/figure-latex//1BQxrVYdKZTbpCaF-i_q9w7s9x034lEXpQZDU-Sl09cs_gff2211b72f_1_82}

\texttt{grabnode}

This command starts an interactive session on the cluster.

\textbf{Node}

One of the networked computers in the cluster.

\textbf{CPU}

A computer component that performs and orchestrates computational tasks.

\textbf{Memory}

A computer component that stores calculations and information in the short term.

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Send an Email}

The primary way you can request help for a problem is to \href{mailto:scicomp@fredhutch.org}{send SciComp an email}, so a ticket will be created in their tracking system. This allows the details of the problem you're having to be sent to them so they can better help you. Submitting a good email ticket helps the SciComp Team address your needs quickly and efficiently. We suggest you submit the following information:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}

\item
  A brief overview of what the problem is.
\item
  Some specifics about the problem, such as the full text (it's ok if it's long) of any error message or terminal command, or a screen shot of the interface you were using when you had the problem.
\item
  A description of what you wanted to have happen or what your overall goal is (in case perhaps there is another strategy that might work better).

Let's review the key information from the previous sections.

\hypertarget{overview}{%
\section{Overview}\label{overview}}

A \protect\hyperlink{what-is-a-cluster}{computing cluster} is a set of computers networked together to perform large tasks. We usually connect to the cluster using a command-line interface called a \protect\hyperlink{terminal}{Terminal}. The Terminal application varies based on your operating system. We connect to the cluster using a secure method called \protect\hyperlink{logging-in}{SSH}. Exact SSH commands vary depending on your operating system.

Before using the Fred Hutch cluster, it's a good idea to \protect\hyperlink{account-setup}{contact the SciComp} team to ensure your account is set up correctly. You must be connected to the campus wifi network, plugged into a networked ethernet jack, or connected to the Fred Hutch VPN to connect to the Fred Hutch cluster.

Computer tasks are typically performed via job submission, where you tell the cluster what to do inside a script file. The Fred Hutch cluster uses \protect\hyperlink{submit-your-first-job}{Slurm} to organize jobs submitted by different users. When building, testing, and debugging jobs, you might want to launch an \protect\hyperlink{interactive-session}{interactive session} on the cluster. You will be asked several questions about resources before your session starts.

You can use the application \protect\hyperlink{file-upload-and-download}{Cyberduck} to transfer smaller files between your local computer and the cluster via SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol). This course does not cover transferring sensitive data, which requires extra precautions.

Don't be afraid to ask for \protect\hyperlink{help}{help}! Check out the SciWiki, join the Slack workspace, or contact the SciComp team if you get stuck.
