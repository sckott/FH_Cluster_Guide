The next step is getting familiar with your Terminal. This is your portal to the cluster.

## What is a terminal?

The Terminal is a [command line interface](https://www.codecademy.com/article/command-line-interface){target="_blank"}. In other words, the Terminal is a software application that allows you to issue commands directly to your laptop or desktop computer. The Terminal is very useful because it allows you to run commands that don't have a point-and-click equivalent. It can also connect you to computer networks, such as the Fred Hutch cluster! The Terminal setup is different depending on your operating system. Jump to the [Windows](#windows), [MacOS](#mac), or [Linux](#linux) sections below.

"Terminal" used to be synonymous with "computer". With the creation of operating systems like Windows and MacOS, computers became much easier to use and exploded in popularity! Your colleagues are almost always referring to the command line application when they say "Terminal".
