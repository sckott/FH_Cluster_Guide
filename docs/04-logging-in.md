Now that you have your Terminal application ready, you want to connect to the cluster. You will do this using a method called [SSH](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/protocol){target="_blank"}, which stands for "Secure SHell".

## What is `SSH`?

SSH is a secure way to remotely connect to another computer or network of computers. In other words, SSH helps us protect your data and the data on the Fred Hutch cluster through authentication.

**Hostname**  
  
The hostname is the name, or label, assigned to a computer in a network. We are connecting to hostname `rhino.fhcrc.org` or `rhino` for short.
</div>

## Connect Securely

Before moving on, you will need to connect to the Fred Hutch wifi network, a networked ethernet jack, or the [Fred Hutch VPN](https://centernet.fredhutch.org/cn/u/center-it/help-desk/vpn.html){target="_blank"}. This is the first layer of security.

The next set of steps are specific to your operating system.
